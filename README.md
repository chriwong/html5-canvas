# `<canvas>`

`<canvas>` elements can be used in one of two ways: the simpler Canvas API or the more involved WebGL API.
* Canvas API seems similar to other drawing libraries (turtle) in which you specify points, paths, and rectangles with pen up/down, stroke, and fill.
* OpenGL was an entirely different beast - the necessity of OpenGL libraries like 3js quickly became apparant.

I will try it next, but experimenting with the built-in Canvas API seemed like a good idea to get my feet wet.
  
This is following the [Chris Course tutorial on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/106rH43@r__qMIUE8tNDFnlv2ncL9eYcP4jXjeHw6nQXPDvLI4WQbjGCGP64Z9UkzmWclOSehg==/). 
However, since I work ahead when I can anticipate what needs to get done next, my code is slightly different.
